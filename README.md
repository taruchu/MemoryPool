# MemoryPool
C++ Project for memory allocation from an arena



Hello :=),

Info: Visual Studio 2015 project using C++ unmanaged.

This is a project of mine to create custom allocation from a memory arena. My plan is to use this in a game engine once
all features are code complete and tested. You can test the functionality that is present.

My future plan is to add concurrent allocation by creating a 
Resource Lifecycle Manager.
